# rock-paper-scissors
A rock, paper, scissors game which runs on the console made using javascript.

The theme of this game is Chris Rock (Rock), Will Smith (Paper) and Jada Smith (Scissors).

The rules are simple.
Rock beats paper through a bad joke.
Paper slaps the heck out of rock.
Finally, scissors beats paper by entangling its brain.

Good luck on slapping the living daylights out of the computer.
